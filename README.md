# Customer Microservice Application

## Setup

### Development

First of all, you have to create a virtual environment and install all necessary libraries. Follow these steps:
```shell
$ virtualenv venv -p 3.12  # Create a virtual environment
$ . venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
$ pip install pip-tools  # Install `pip-tools` library to manage project dependencies
$ inv packages.install  # Install all necessary dependencies for the local development
```

After this, you can start developing.

### Run Application Locally

After you've completed all the prerequisites, you can start the application locally. Just run this command:
```shell
$ inv infra.up  # Starts all infrastructure locally: database, application, migration service
```

Now, you can access the application on `localhost:8000`. Here are some useful links:
1. OpenAPI Documentation - `localhost:8000/docs/`
2. Redoc Documentation - `localhost:8000/redoc/`

### Configuration

You can configure how the application is deployed locally via the `.env.local` file. Take a look:
```shell

```

## CLI Commands

During the development, we can utilize some CLI commands. We can run them using the `invoke` library.

### Packages

Commands in this section provide an opportunity to work with project dependencies:
```shell
$ inv packages.compile  # Compiles libraries into requirements file. The default output file is `requirements.local.txt`
$ inv packages.install  # Installs packages from the file with dependencies. The default dependency file is `requirements.local.txt`
```

### Infra

Commands in this section provide an opportunity to manage local infrastructure for the development:
```shell
$ inv infra.up  # Starts local infrastructure for the application: database, web-app, etc.
$ inv infra.down  # Stops and removes all docker containers used for the local infrastructure
$ inv infra.build  # Builds images that are described in the `docker-compose.local.yaml` file
```

### Migration
Handles logic of creating & applying database migrations files:
```shell
$ inv migration.run  # Applies migration files
$ inv migration.autogenerate  # Generates new migration file with the latest model changes
```



## Development Flow

### Commits

Commits' messages should be written using the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

Conventional commits [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13).

### Branches

`main` branch:
* Contains tested and stable code.

Feature branches should be named using the following convention:
* `feature/create-order`
* `feature/delete-comment`
* `feature/base-code`

As a result, the branch describes what it should do:
* **Feature** will add functionality to **create order**...
* **Feature** will add functionality to **delete order**...
* **Feature** will add **base code**...

### Merge Requests

Use the following rules before creating a merge request:
* Code must be tested locally.
* The merge commit message must describe which feature was merged into `main`.
* Merge request must have a description.
* Merge request must contain a link to the ticket.
